    <li> Level-Easy consists of only 2 colors whereas, Level-Hard contains 4 colors</li>
    <li> On entering the game you will see the ball at the bottom of the page.</li>
    <li> On tapping the screen the ball would bounce up and drop down. </li>
    <li> The main Objective of the game is to bounce and move up the screen.</li>
    <li> The distance the ball moves up, your score increases gradually</li>
    <li> To gain a score of 1 you need to move up to cross the Checkpoints</li>
    <li> Each Checkpoints are denoted by a star</li>
    <li> On moving up you would face a lot of obstacles and you need to cross them</li>
    <li> As you move up to great distances the speed of the obstacles you face would gradually increase (by a factor of 1.05)</li>
    <li> On the way, you would face many Color Switch balls which changes your ball color</li>
    <li> You have to be careful during the color switch</li>
